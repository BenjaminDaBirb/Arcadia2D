**Development Is On Hold For Now!**

*A small **2D Engine** I'am working on, It uses C++ as it's core language and SDL library for handling input, sound & rendering.*

**Note** - *The engine is not marked as for the production use! It currently lacks the audio, animation and particle system and much more features which are yet to be implemented! It currently has an input system, rendering feature (Which only renders a png file given in ***/assets*** directory), texture management system & 2d Vector and transformation features! There are many features and systems which are yet to be implemented.*

## Contributions!
The best you can do is fork this repository and make pull requests through the forked version whenever you make changes in the source code.

2 years later - This section sounds pretty much stupid, doesn't it? Well yeah, that's me 2 years ago posting the source code of a software which I claim to be "proprietary" on an open-source coding and software platform, and then asking users not to fork it for their personal motives as it is personal and properietary, ironic.
