# Arcadia2D
**Development Is On Hold For Now!**

*A small **2D Engine** I'am working on, It uses C++ as it's core language and SDL library for handling input, sound & rendering.*

**Note** - *The engine is not marked as for the production use! It currently lacks the audio, animation and particle system and much more features which are yet to be implemented! It currently has an input system, rendering feature (Which only renders a png file given in ***/assets*** directory), texture management system & 2d Vector and transformation features! There are many features and systems which are yet to be implemented.*
