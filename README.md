First off, People are NOT allowed to create Forks of the engine, creating forks are only allowed for Pull Request contributions! Any forks that do not seem to contribute will be reported. This is done to prevent source code being stolen and multiple third-parties claiming the software and source code as their own in a different disguise!

If you want to use the Fork the software for a different purpose or the same purpose but without evil intentions, please email at ludens-workshop@outlook.com to seek the permission.
